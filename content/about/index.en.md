I live in Tweede ExloÃ«rmond. I am a self-employed entrepreneur, father and husband. Together with my parent I run a 'Spar' supermarket in the beautiful town named Exloo. I have always had a passion for photography, web design and tennis.

For me, photography is a way to capture the world around me and preserve special moments forever. I love capturing the beauty in the smallest details and thus increasing the value of the moment.

I am also interested in web design, because I believe that the internet is the future. I love creating beautiful, user-friendly websites and was playing with this from a young age.

Finally, I am also an avid tennis player. I love being on the court and improving my skills. The feeling of the ball landing in exactly the right place and the thrill of winning a match give me immense satisfaction.

So that's a little about me. If you would like to know more, please send me a message!
