Welcome to my page! My name is Dennis, and I am not only the proud owner of a Spar supermarket in Exloo, but I also have a passion for various activities.

In the world of groceries and customer service, I feel completely in my element. My Spar supermarket is not just a store; it's a place where people come together, where quality and service go hand in hand. My goal is to ensure that every customer leaves with a smile, knowing that they have not only shopped but have experienced something special.

In addition to my work in the supermarket, I have various hobbies that enrich my life. I am an avid tennis player, a sport that keeps not only my body in motion but also sharpens my mind. Tennis, for me, is more than just a sport; it's a way to relax and enjoy the moment.

Cooking is another passion I cherish. As a lover of flavors and culinary creativity, I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen. Whether preparing traditional dishes or trying out new recipes, cooking is an art form where I let my creativity run wild.

During my free time, you'll often find me behind the computer, working on hobby web development. It's fascinating to see how technology is changing the world, and building websites allows me to share my ideas and passions online.

Photography has recently become an interest of mine, and I am determined to explore the world of capturing moments through images. Documenting emotions and scenes through photography resonates with me, and I look forward to further developing my skills in this area.

Beyond my entrepreneurship and diverse hobbies, I am also a devoted father to an amazing son and the fortunate husband of a wonderful partner. My family is the driving force behind everything I do, inspiring me every day to bring out the best in myself.

I invite you to follow my journey, both in the supermarket and beyond. Thank you for stopping by and sharing this journey with me!
